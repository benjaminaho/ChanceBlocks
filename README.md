# ChanceBlocks

[ChanceBlocks](https://www.chanceblocks.com) is a responsive web application which allows users to design random variables and build custom reports detailing their outputs. Current version 1.3 supports discrete random variables with an individually selected relative probability for each element. The Python Flask application server uses MySQLdb to communicate with MySQL (no ORM). The front end is written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML with Jinja2 syntax for template rendering from the server, and CSS Bulma.
